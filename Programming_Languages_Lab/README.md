This assignment was a group lab from the Programming Languages class. The lab was a 3-part lab that had us implementing a basic Scheme interpreter using Scala. This assignment has us focus on basic components of Scheme, such as let-bindings and lambda expressions. The goal of the lab was to let users compute simple Scheme arithmetic and String expressions. I chose this assignment because it is perhaps the hardest assignment I have ever completed. We were writing an interpreter for a language, which is difficult in itself, let alone in a language we had no experience with. This assignment really made clear to me how difficult it is to write a programming language.

This project addresses the Computer Science learning goal **To understand	the	concepts and techniques of software design** and **To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting** because I had to work in a group and learn the kind of decisions programming language developers consider when writing languages . This project also addresses the college-wide learning goals **Creativity** and **Critical Thinking**.
