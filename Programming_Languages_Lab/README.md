This assignment was the final assignment for the Programming Languages class. The assignment was to use a language called Elm to build a web project. Elm is a purely functional programming language that advertises no run-time errors, which is possible because of it's static type-checking. My project is a website that details the environmental harms of factory farming animals. The user can adjust a slider to see the environmental impact of consuming varying amounts animal products.

This project addresses the Computer Science learning goal **To understand	the	concepts and techniques of software design** and the college-wide learning goals **Creativity** and **Critical Thinking**. The goal of the project was to apply functional programming concepts to a new situation and to build a creative application.
