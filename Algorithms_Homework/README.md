This assignment was a graph algorithm assignment in the Algorithms and Data Structures class. The goal of this assignment was to implement the DFS, BFS, UCS, Bestfit, and A* algorithms to solve a maze. There were several different mazes that we ran the algorithms against. We compared the number of moves it took to solve the maze, and unsurprisingly, A* was the fastest algorithm.

This assignment addresses the Computer Science learning goal **To develop effective problem solving skills** because I had to figure out how to implement each algorithm and apply those implementations to solve a maze.
