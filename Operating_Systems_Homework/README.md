This assignment was the final assignment for the Operating Systems class. The goal of the assignment was to write a memory manager, similar to what real operating systems use. The program translates logical addresses to physical addresses by acquiring the page number of the logical address; checking the TLB and the page table for the corresponding physical frame; retrieving the byte at the offset of the logical address; and printing the physical address, value at the offset, the page fault rate, and the number of TLB hits. The program uses the FIFO algorithm to update pages in the TLB. I chose this assigment because it is the culmination of our study of memory management. Actually implementing a page table and TLB really drove home how to translate a logical address to a physical address and how modern operating systems do the same thing, but on a much larger scale. 

This assignment addresses the Computer Science learning goals **To attain a system level understanding of the computer** and
**To develop effective problem solving skills** because I had to understand how logical address are represented, how to translate a logical address to a page number and an offset, and how to load pages into a page table in case of a page fault. I also had to choose the correct data structures to represent page table entries and page frames.
