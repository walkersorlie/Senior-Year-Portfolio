This assignment was the final assignment for the Computer Networks class. The assignment was to develop a chat room application that could accept connections and send messages, all specified by a protocal the class decided on. I worked in a team of 2 to develop our application. We built upon a base framework that we had developed all semester (with a server, client, and a handler) to handle connections and to send messages.

This assignment addresses the Computer Science learning goals **To attain a system level understanding of the computer** and **To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting** because I worked with a partner and we had to understand socket connections and other network-related protocols. This project also addresses the college-wide learning goals **Critical thinking**, **Creativity**, **Collaboration**, and **Communication**.
